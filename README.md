# AntiSocial-online-Behavior-detection-model
Introduction:

Detecting anti-social online behaviour is crucial for ensuring safer digital environments. This task involves identifying harmful or disruptive content, often requiring sophisticated models to capture patterns in text. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to extract local features from the input, while recurrent models like GRU, Bi-GRU, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM effectively capture sequential dependencies. 
Combining these techniques leverages their strengths in both feature extraction and sequence learning, improving detection accuracy. 
This hybrid approach enhances the ability to detect nuanced anti-social behaviours in online communication.

Objective:

Consolidate prior work on the detection, and textual content classification and furnish a complete benchmark of choice textual content processing approaches.
Collect and pre-process the data.
Build and consider the performance of deep mastering models.
Investigate the viability of deep NLP switch studying for AOB Detection.

Model Building:

The project provides the solution to the proposed problem statement using deep learning models. The construction of deep learning models in Keras API has the following steps:
Define model: Create a sequence and add layers.
Compile model: Specify loss functions and optimizers.
Fit model: Execute the model using data.
Make predictions: Use the model to generate predictions on new data.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied for question categorization and sentence-level sentiment analysis. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been implemented to model text sequences in a corpus.
The high-level conceptual framework is presented in the figure below.
